<div class="moringa"> 
    <li><strong>MORINGA-QA</strong></li>
    <P>During the first and second week at Moringa, students faced issues with their assignment and the only place provided to raise them was in slack chats, 
        because all students weren't moving in the same pace, 
        repetition of questions was many and no one was willing to answer the question twice,
        this has led to decline of question submission in the channel.
        The online forum will help in reducing the number of duplicate questions and save time for those in need of help. 
        It will also restrict those who haven't reached a certain lesson from viewing contents a head of them to minimize cheat.</P>
